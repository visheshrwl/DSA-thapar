# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice Repository! This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding and implementation skills of various data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific type of data structure, algorithm, or a set of related questions.

Each folder's "README.md" file provides:

- A description of the problem or algorithm being discussed.
- A detailed explanation of the approach used in the solution.cpp file.
- If applicable, a breakdown of the time and space complexity of the solution.
- Tips and insights to help you better understand the concept.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to this repository are welcomed! If you've solved a problem and would like to share your solution:

Fork this repository.
- Create a new folder under the relevant category
- Inside the new folder, create a solution.cpp file with your code and a README.md file explaining your approach.
- Submit a pull request with your changes.
- Please ensure that your code is well-documented, follows best practices, and is easy for others to understand.

## Learning Resources 

Remember that while practicing, it's important to also refer to learning resources like textbooks, online tutorials, and videos to deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms. The provided README.md files aim to help you understand specific solutions, but additional learning materials can provide you with a broader perspective.

Happy coding and practicing! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
